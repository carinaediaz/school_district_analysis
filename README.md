# School District Analysis
## Overview
##### Assisting the school board with analyzing the standardized testing results of 15 high schools within the same school district to provide insight into performance trends and patterns. As we were reaching the end of our analysis, we were notified by the school board that there was evidence of academic dishonesty among Thomas High School ninth graders'. To make our analysis as accurate as possible, we modified our Python code to edit the dataset to replace NaNs for all Thomas High School ninth graders' math and reading scores.
## Results
##### Upon editing our dataset, we were able to identify several differences in the results with all students vs. without Thomas High School ninth graders. The differences and their impacts are shown and discussed below. 

### How is the district summary affected?

Running our analysis for all of the students within the district, we found that 75% of students passed math, 86% passed reading, and 65% of students passed both exams.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade

![Math by Grade_ver2.PNG](https://github.com/carinaediaz/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Math%20by%20Grade_ver2.PNG)
![Reading by Grade_ver1.PNG](https://github.com/carinaediaz/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Reading%20by%20Grade_ver1.PNG)

#### Scores by school spending

![Scores by Spending_ver2.PNG](https://github.com/carinaediaz/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Scores%20by%20Size_ver2.PNG)
Thomas High School falls into the $631-645 spending budget range. Because changes were only made to Thomas High School's test results, the other spending categories will not see any changes to their results. 

#### Scores by school size

![Scores by Size_ver2.PNG](https://github.com/carinaediaz/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Scores%20by%20Size_ver2.PNG)
Thomas High School has 1,635 students, falling into the medium school size cateogry, therefore we will only see changes in the passing percentages for the medium high school category. 

#### Scores by school type

![Scores by Type_ver2.PNG](https://github.com/carinaediaz/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Scores%20by%20Type_ver2.PNG)
Thomas High School is a charter school. The changes in percentages for charter high schools are nominal. 

## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
